# Prime Factors 

## TL;DR;

Given a number, the program should return a list containing all the prime numbers greater than 1 that compose it.

## Examples :

* 3 should return [3]
* 4 should return [2, 2] 
* 6 should return [2, 3] 
* 8 should return [2, 2, 2] 
* ...

## Extra constraints :

To complete the initial implementation, it is then possible to implement these constraints :

* Negative numbers should throw an IllegalArgumentException
* The list should be ordered
